This application uses NodeJS to pull data from an external file, Twitter, OMDb, and Spotify. All results are also recorded in a log.txt file. Node modules and data were gathered from npmjs.com.

Just type the following commands in the terminal:
node liri.js my-tweets
node liri.js spotify-this-song "your song choice"
node liri.js movie-this "your movie choice"
node liri.js do-what-it-says
